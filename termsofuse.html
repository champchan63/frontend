        SENDING ORDERS TO RESTAURANTS<br>
        This section applies to orders placed by the APPLICATION where this service is offered. Please
        read this section before sending an order to restaurants using the APPLICATION.
        Each restaurant is owned and managed by an independent company: Although there may be a
        parent company that operates and controls the APPLICATION, it is not responsible for the
        restaurant operations. Most restaurants are owned and operated by independent owners.
        Some restaurants are operated by subsidiaries of the parent company (such subsidiaries are
        collectively called "RESTAURANTS"). Each restaurant is fully and independently responsible for
        its legal and regulatory compliance with respect to any problem related to the supply of
        products to you and any issues related to employment in the restaurant.<br>
        Orders: The purpose of ordering is to offer customers a convenient way that allows them to
        create an order for products in advance and submit by registering at a participating restaurant.
        Before you order, you can create an account in the APPLICATION. Before submitting an order,
        you must register a credit card (a "PAYMENT CARD") on which your order payments will be
        applied. For the order to be submitted, you may need to enable location services on your
        device.<br>
        Registering your payment method: The RESTAURANT and RESTAURANTS rely on the services of
        independent suppliers to save your credit card (Visa and/or MasterCard) and process
        RESTAURANT payments. You understand and agree that when you register a PAYMENT CARD,
        the RESTAURANT or its independent providers can verify the validity of the registered
        PAYMENT CARD. You also understand and agree that when placing an order at a RESTAURANT,
        the RESTAURANT will be the merchant. To pick up your order at the counter or during
        delivery, you must present the credit card used for payment as well as a photo ID. These
        identity documents are essential in order to receive your order. Restaurants reserve the right
        not to provide or deliver orders to anyone who would not have these documents. YOU
        WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE REACHED THE SUFFICIENT AGE AND HOLD ALL THE LEGAL RIGHTS
        TO USE ALL PAYMENT CARDS YOU REGISTER.<br>
        SPECIAL CONDITIONS FOR THE LOYALTY PROGRAM<br>
        All rights reserved to the RESTAURANT.</p>
